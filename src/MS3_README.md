## Performance Implications
### Inside the Library

#### Pros:

* Efficiency: Integrating key transformations directly within the library can lead to more efficient processing, as transformations are applied inline during the conversion process, avoiding additional iteration over the resulting JSON object.

* Simplicity for Clients: Clients benefit from a simplified interface, as they do not need to implement their own transformation logic, making client code cleaner and more maintainable.

* Consistency: Centralizing the transformation logic within the library ensures consistent application of transformations across different projects or components using the library.

#### Cons:

* Complexity: Incorporating transformation logic into the library increases its complexity, which may introduce bugs and increase the maintenance burden.

* Potential Overhead: Clients not requiring key transformations may experience unnecessary performance overhead due to the transformation logic being part of the core processing.

* Flexibility: The library may not accommodate all potential transformation requirements, limiting clients who have specific or complex transformation needs.

### In Client Code
#### Pros:

* Control and Flexibility: Clients have full control over the transformation process, allowing for highly customized transformations that meet specific requirements.

* Simplified Library: Keeping the library focused on XML to JSON conversion without built-in transformation logic keeps the library simpler and potentially more reliable.

* Selective Performance Impact: Only clients that require key transformations will incur the associated performance overhead.

#### Cons:

* Effort Duplication: If key transformations are a common requirement, individual implementations by clients can lead to duplicated effort.

* Inconsistencies: Varied implementations of transformation logic by different clients can lead to inconsistencies in the transformed keys across projects.

* Increased Client Complexity: Implementing transformation logic in client code can complicate the codebase and increase the potential for errors.
